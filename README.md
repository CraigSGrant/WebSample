# WebSample
-------------
This is a simple one page site build out for a client that wanted a code challenge built to make additional hires and to help their devs have something to compare it to without having to take the time to do it themselves (thus losing time on current client work.)

I will be updating this project in the coming days/weeks once I get confirmation on the mobile changes I am making to their repo and pushing said changes to this one after they allow me to release the code.

To run locally: cd public/

       new tab: gulp
